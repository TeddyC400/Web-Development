            <p><blockquote>The relationship between grizzly bears and other predators is mostly one-sided; grizzly bears will approach feeding predators to steal their kill. In general, the other species will leave the carcasses for the bear to avoid competition or predation.</blockquote> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly_bear">Wikipedia</a></p>

            <p><blockquote>Grizzlies are considered more aggressive compared to black bears when defending themselves and their offspring. Unlike the smaller black bears, adult grizzlies do not climb trees well, and respond to danger by standing their ground and warding off their attackers. Mothers defending cubs are the most prone to attacking, and are responsible for 70% of humans killed by grizzlies.</blockquote> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly_bear">Wikipedia</a></p>
