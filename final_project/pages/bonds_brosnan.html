                        GoldenEye is definitely one of the top 3 best James Bond films ever produced. The action spy thriller is incredibly engaging and you can never get your eyes off the
                        screen. As Pierce Brosnan's first Bond film, he seriously nailed Bond's look and charisma. This movie would be 10/10 if the unrealistic, mass murdering Bond did not
                        exist because Bond is not a machine gunner, he's a spy! Thanks to this film, it created the best video game ever, GoldenEye N64.

                        Pierce Brosnan's 2nd Bond film is amazing. While it is not better than <i>GoldenEye</i>, it still has a very unique villian who tries to cause a war between the
                        Western world and China by using his media empire. People should definitely learn from the villian considering that the media can be a dangerous tool for war.

                        Brosnan's films starts to become a little bit boring. It is still a good film, but it is not as good as the 1st and 2nd Brosnan films which were way better.

                        As Brosnan's final film, it was definitely the weakest out of the four. It tries too hard on CGI and absurd modern action fights. This film is honestly not terrible,
                        but it is definitely one of the lowest rating Bond films in the franchise. Anyone who has watched this movie before will know that this one contains the worst CGI
                        ever, the giant ocean wave scene. As for final thoughts, Brosnan did really well in his first 2 films, then the plot and quality sort of dropped because it tries
                        too hard to be modern and use CGI. Brosnan's Bond look is definitely the best though.
