                <h2>Every Main Bond Actors</h2>
                <p>
                    All the Bond actors in this list have been portrayed in the popular James Bond movies produced by Eon Productions. Eon
                    produced films that hit a combined gross of nearly $7 billion, making it the sixth highest grossing film series.

                <p>
                    Sean Connery is the actor that defined and made James Bond what it is now today. All seven of Connery's James Bond films were a smashing hit,
                    which led James Bond to continue to what it is nearly 58 years later. Ironically enough, Ian Fleming did not view Connery as suitable for James Bond
                    due to his appearance looking like an "overgrown stunt-man."

                <p>
                    George Lazenby is the 2nd actor to become the iconic James Bond and was the youngest to become James bond. Only portraying in one film, Lazenby is
                    the least popular and the most forgettable James Bond actor to this date. After his first film, he decides to quit and move on with other things.
                    This ultimately led to this career downfall.

                <p>
                    After Connery's depature from James Bond and Lazenby's disappearance, Roger Moore steps in to play James Bond for the next 12 years. Moore's approach
                    to James Bond is more charismatic, humorous, and less cold blooded than Connery's. Moore still hits the record as the oldest James Bond to this date,
                    which did cause some controversy among the audience.

                <p>
                    After Moore's era came to end, James Bond needed a new actor that would shake up the style and be more serious. Timothy Dalton, a long time Bond fan
                    and reader of the novels, comes into the scene as a more cold blooded and gritty James Bond. Out of all the other Bond actors, Dalton still holds up
                    as the most faithful to the Bond novels. Unfortunately, Dalton's career becomes short-sighted as his two films are at the bottom of the highest
                    grossing bond films.

                <p>
                    Originally, Pierce Brosnan was meant to take the role as James Bond before Timothy Dalton became Bond. But, due to contract issues, he was not able to
                    become Bond until 1995. His portrayal as Bond became a smashing hit, leading to the creation of three more Bond films and one of the most iconic video
                    games of all time, Goldeneye N64.

                <p>
                    The current James Bond, Daniel Craig, is approaching the end of his era. Craig portrays his Bond similar to Dalton's, dark and gritty. Based on his
                    appearance, Craig received a lot of controversy back in his first film due to his blonde hair. However, times changed and his films are among the top
                    best in the Bond list.
