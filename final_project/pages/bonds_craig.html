                        As Daniel Craig's introduction to the franchise, he definitely nailed Bond similar to Timothy Dalton's bond, dark and gritty. Bond having emotions is really
                        powerful and shows that he is not just a cold blooded maniac who is out to kill people. The rating is well deserved and it is a great start for Craig's career.

                        Those who have watched the entire Bond franchise would know this movie is one of the worst. The plot is very dull and the villian is terrible. Even the action
                        scenes are not enough to fix the root problems the film has to show. It sucks that Craig's first film was successful and then this movie NEARLY damages his
                        career.

                        This film seriously saved Craig's career after the disasterous 2nd film. Luckily, this became the highest grossing film in the whole franchise. This film can
                        contest against <i>GoldenEye</i> and <i>Goldfinger</i>, which are also the two best movies in the Bond franchise. Craig's performance is amazing as usual.

                        This film is not bad by any means, but it is not really as good as <i>Casino Royale</i> or <i>Skyfall</i>. The plot is average and not really that exciting to watch.

                        The film is not out yet, but it will on November 25, 2020. Final thoughts about Daniel Craig, I think he is a really great Bond. He is definitely a great spy, but he felt
                        different from other Bonds because he is part of the modern cinematic history where action and CGI are prevalant. I will definitely miss him as James Bond considering that
                        I grew up primarily during his era.
