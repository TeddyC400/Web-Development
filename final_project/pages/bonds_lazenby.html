                        After many James Bond films came out after this one, this film lost its popularity and George Lazenby became the least rated James Bond. Personally, this film
                        is actually really good, however the plot can be a little slow at times. The place it took place in, Switzerland, is amazing and the fact that this is the only
                        movie where James Bond gets married and has a love interest is extremely unique. This film did not deserve the hate to be honest and if Lazenby had more films,
                        it would be fair to judge his rating.
