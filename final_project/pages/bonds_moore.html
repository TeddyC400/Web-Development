                        With Connery gone and Roger Moore taking over, his first impression as James Bond is honestly not too bad. The villians are actually quite good and the
                        overall plot is satisfactory at best. It is not really as great as Connery's first three films, which felt more like Bond is a spy and not a charismatic lover.

                        I honestly never understood the low rating for this movie. Sure, there are some pretty bad scenes (looking at you, corkscrew jump). The villian's side character,
                        Nick Nack, is honestly one of the best side characters I have ever seen. The duel between the villian and Bond is seriously engaging and intense. The villian almost
                        defeats James Bond, similar to Red Grant from Sean Connery's <i>From Russia With Love</i>.

                        This is truly the best Bond film by Roger Moore. The introduction of the iconic character, Jaws, and the female Russian spy are seriously great. However, my only
                        issue is that the main villian, Stromberg, is not really interesting and dies pathetically easily. Aside from that, the plot is fascinating and I wish there is
                        another James Bond film with a female spy collaborating with Bond.

                        I am surprised the ratings for this film is much higher. If you have ever watched this movie, you will see why I think it is the worst Roger Moore film ever made.
                        The space battle is hilariously unrealistic and removes the element of being a spy. The reason why the space battle even exists is because Star Wars was popular
                        during the time this film was in production. Jaws is also featured in this film, but went from an evil henchman to an empathetic and caring man who sides with Bond
                        at the end of the movie. I believe the shift in Jaws's story could have been better and that he still should have despised Bond. I will give credit to the producers
                        for making a plot about James Bond being in space, but the execution is hilariously awful.

                        The plot twist in this film is well done and unexpected. While it's not the craziest plot twist in the world, it does drive the plot forward in an interesting way.
                        Overall, it's not an amazing film, but it is good in its own way. There are several scenes that is boring, so that is why it lost a point.

                        I thought I was going to go into this film thinking it was a joke and only involves love and comedy. Turns out I was wrong. This movie is legitimately good. The
                        villians are threatening and almost had a good chance of killing Bond. However, there are some bad spots, such as the goofy ending with Bond in a clown costume.
                        Whether it was intentional for comedy or not, it still did drive the plot forward and was done for a good reason. I am not sure why people would rate this low
                        since the film is actually pretty enjoyable to watch.

                        This is not a bad film by all means. The problem with this movie is that Moore feels too old for this. Aside from that, the villian, Zorin, is quite insane and his plan
                        to cause a massive tectonic plate rupture in California is a good, evil plan. Final thoughts, Roger Moore is really not bad as James Bond, but he does portray Bond very
                        differently from other actors, who are more cold blooded and darker. Moore's take on Bond is really unique, but the fact that he went for 7 Bond movies did get boring
                        and he should have ended either after <i>For Your Eyes Only</i> or <i>Octopussy</i>.
