                <p>
                    All the books are made by Ian Fleming himself between 1953 and 1966. He published 14 books in total, 12 which are novels and the last 2 which are
                    short books, <i>The Man with the Golden Gun</i> and <i>Octopussy and The Living Daylights</i>. Most of the movie titles come from these book names.
                    There are more novels based on James Bond that were published after 1966 not by Ian Fleming. For more information on that, proceed to this

                        <br><b>"The Living Daylights"</b> Bond is assigned sniper duty, but when he sees the sniper is a beautiful woman, he shoots the butt of her rifle instead of killing her.

                        <br><b>"007 in New York"</b> Bond warns a female MI6 employee that her new boyfriend is a KGB agent.
