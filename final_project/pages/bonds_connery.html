                        It is a great starting James Bond movie of the whole franchise. The introduction of James Bond is extremely iconic and well done. However, compared to its
                        successors, it does fall behind in terms of quality and plot strength.

                        As the 2nd installment in the franchise, it does extraordinary well introducing SPECTRE, a criminal organization that shows up in the next several movies.
                        Bond's rival, Red Grant, is easily one of the top best rivals Bond had to challenge due to expert hand to hand combat skills and assassinating. Easily one of
                        the top five best James Bond movies ever.

                        Coming in as the 3rd movie of Sean Connery's era, it is considered by many to be the best James Bond film ever produced. The plot is extremely engaging
                        and Goldfinger, the villian, has an absurd and sinister plan to jack up the price of gold by destroying the United State's gold at Fort Knox.

                        This film is still enjoyable to watch, but the absurd amount of film time spent under water is too high. The under water scenes are very slow and it is
                        sometimes very hard to actually understand what is happening when fight scenes starts happening. But besides that, the plot is very interesting and
                        Largo, the villian, is actually really cool.

                        Most people would rate this higher, but I find this movie to be incredibly boring up until the ending. The introduction of Ernst Stavro Blofeld who is the
                        leader of SPECTRE is really nice, but felt wasted and not really exciting at all. When he was revealed, he just appears and looks at James Bond then resumes with
                        his important mission. The buildup of the plot is average, and the final action scene was really the only one that was amazing to watch.

                        Originally, Sean Conner was meant to retire as James Bond after <i>You Only Live Twice</i> but was given a chance to do another film. The villian is the same
                        villian as the last Connery film, Blofeld, but different actor. Blofeld in this movie is significantly worse than Blofeld from <i>You Only Live Twice</i> mostly
                        due to the fact that Blofeld in this one is silly and not as sinister as the previous. This film could have been a lot better if Connery did not return since you
                        can tell by his face that he is getting too old. This is not his last film as James Bond since he does do another one called <i>Never Say Never Again</i>
                        which is based off of Ian Fleming's novel, <i>Thunderball</i>. It will not be mentioned because I do not consider it canon and it is awful.
